Can someone please help with this code? Someone wrote it for me on r/armadev and it works on local host and single player but doesnt work on dedicated server. What it does is locate a thrown purple smoke grenade within a marker and make it has infinite smoke plume. The trigger associated with it fires and completes the task but the smoke grenade doesn't quite work. Instead of infinite smoke plume the grenade pops and smokes for a second or two then is deleted and no smoke is created after it is deleted.

I see delete vehicle thrown smoke in there which makes me think that part is working. Then I see createvehicleLocal. I suspect this to be the issue because the smoke emitter is never created. I also see it says Local
```if (isNil "mission_SmokeinLZArea") then {
	_player addEventHandler ["FiredMan", {
		params ["_unit", "_weapon", "_muzzle", "_mode", "_ammo", "_magazine", "_projectile", "_vehicle"];
		if !isNil "mission_SmokeinLZArea" exitWith {
			_unit removeEventHandler [_thisEvent, _thisEventHandler];
		};
		if (_weapon == "Throw" && {_magazine == "vn_m18_purple_mag"} && {_unit inArea "marker_1_lzArea"}) then {
			[_projectile] spawn {
				params ["_thrownSmoke"];
				waitUntil {uiSleep 1; abs speed _thrownSmoke == 0};
				if !(_thrownSmoke inArea "marker_1_lzArea") exitWith {};
				missionNamespace setVariable ["mission_SmokeinLZArea", true, true];
				private _smokeEmitter = "ModuleSmoke_F" createVehicleLocal getPos _thrownSmoke;
				_smokeEmitter setVariable ["repeat", 1];
				_smokeEmitter setVariable ["type", "SmokeShellPurple"];
				deleteVehicle _thrownSmoke;
			};
		};
	}];
};```
