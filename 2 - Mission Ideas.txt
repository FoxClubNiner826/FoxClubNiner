Before you publish to workshop do this:
- Change weather and time to starting point 00.15.00
- Uncheck take damage

Mission Notes:
If you can't get the smoke grenade thing to work out you could create civilian present trigger to tell player when to throw the smoke on the ground. The heli will land anyway but it gets around the infi smoke hurdle. You could event have an event failed with a radio message saying hey throw a fucking smoke next time!
