PRIORITY: FINISH THE MAIN QUEST!

TO DO UP NEXT:
briefing trigger need some work since they fire 2 at the same time
if you throw a smoke before lz task pops up then it wont complete and no inf smoke
using get in from within the heli causes it to hover
make sound file smaller and try it that way. will have to adjust time in sqfs
end mission page to tell players why they died.
mission fail for leaving a player behind
what to do with pilot or hostage on base return. currently they stay in chopper

TO DO AT SOME POINT:
randomize cloud cover at mission start
convert lumphat files to hold actions
disable the radio after testing because it does help during that.
BIS_fnc_ambientAnimCombat and another function that does idle stuff in start area.
how to set server distance view
add questions for lt rankin at beginning
update briefing pics
add AAR for lt. rankin (just need to record lines)
have a trigger check for group size and change helicopter to fit size

BUGS:
- Fog never clearing up because forgot to script it that way.
- Some sub tasks are out of there main categories. Resolves on mission restart.
- my computer freezes when entering helo for about 5 seconds.
- couldn't get in boat until other players exited
- missile wont down pilot
- players dont always end up in boat with skip to ingress
- if hvt fail have hq radio players saying they monitor radio traffic and the chicken has 	flown the coup. "see if you can find anything in lumphat at your discretion"
- search lumphat optional task doesn't complete
- disable jukebox by looking at the module code in function viewer

JIP ISSUES:
- if a player leaves and he had an ai in his group then no one else can control the AI. The AI becomes invincible. maybe the enable damage reverts? I think
so because this doesnt happen with the POW
- player may not have access to their loadout from the stab if they have scuba equipped and leave and rejoin.
- some combination of JIP players coming and going cause some tasks to cycle through when a player joins. Does not seem to affect the sync of the tasks though.
- If a player leaves and his AI is killed its loadout reverts. Face still working tho.

BEFORE PUBLISH:
read description.ext on wiki to polish load screens, etc

FINISHED:

- POW task should be good. all tested except helicopter and exfil
- rescue pilot task should be good. needs testing and esp at extract
- adjusted naval wait triggers so that you can now fail after passing.
- added fail mission trigger if stab is destroyed before reaching infil point
- added exfil trigger that checks for players in the trigger area and alive and in the extract helicopter
- added pilot trigger that checks for pilot back at base and completes task
- added pow trigger that checks for pilot back at base and completes task
- add side chat to pow heal. "its no use. My leg is ruined". in the future randomize 3 responses.
- moved time bombs to IPL
