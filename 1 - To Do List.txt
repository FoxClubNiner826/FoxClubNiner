PRIORITY: FINISH THE MAIN QUEST!

TO DO UP NEXT:
go through IPL and move any addactions that need to be in OPR

TO DO AT SOME POINT:
how to set server distance view
add questions for lt rankin at beginning
update briefing pics
add AAR for lt. rankin (just need to record lines)

TO DO SIDE QUEST:
randomized marker for pilot

BUGS:
- Fog never clearing up because forgot to script it that way.
- Some sub tasks are out of there main categories. Resolves on mission restart.
- my computer freezes when entering helo for about 5 seconds.
- couldn't get in boat until other players exited
- missile wont down pilot
- players dont always end up in boat with skip to ingress
- if hvt fail have hq radio players saying they monitor radio traffic and the chicken has 	flown the coup. "see if you can find anything in lumphat at your discretion"
- search lumphat optional task doesn't complete
- disable jukebox by looking at the module code in function viewer

JIP ISSUES:
- player may not have access to their loadout from the stab if they have scuba equipped and leave and rejoin.
- some combination of JIP players coming and going cause some tasks to cycle through when a player joins. Does not seem to affect the sync of the tasks though.
- If a player leaves and his AI is killed its loadout reverts. Face still working tho.

BEFORE PUBLISH:
add a big enough extract helo for all players. maybe you can change the unit type by script based on how many players are in game.
read description.ext on wiki to polish load screens, etc

FINISHED:
-JIP intro type text
-JIP skip to ingress removed near mission start

-JIP scuba gear available
-JIP time bombs
- update briefing screen to current point
- update tasks to current point
- new helo extraction with addactions
- end mission addaction
- ambient voices for blurfor team disabled
- 3 questions for captain added in beginning
- AI and players keep loadoutgear and faces (not JIP friendly)
- optimization pass (most objects have dynamic sim, some got changed to simple obj, but the biggest factor for performance is number of AI and draw distance)
- fade in on mission start
- added new start task 
- built up starting area
- INFINITE SMOKE!!
- added lines for end mission briefing
- update all previous tasks to be completed for skip to ingress.
